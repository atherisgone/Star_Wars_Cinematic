## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

This project was built as a **learning-driven cinematic**, covering the full real-time pipeline:

### 🔹 Modeling
- Working with high-poly and mid-poly assets
- Importing and optimizing external meshes
- Managing scale consistency across large scenes

### 🔹 Lighting
- Cinematic lighting setups
- Practical vs stylized lighting decisions
- Depth, contrast, and subject separation
- Using light to guide viewer focus

### 🔹 Scene Decoration
- Large-scale environment composition
- Repetition handling
- Set dressing for cinematic framing

### 🔹 Animation & Sequencer
- Sequencer workflow
- Character and crowd animation timing
- Shot-based storytelling
- Coordinating animation with camera movement

### 🔹 Camera, Rigs & Cinematics
