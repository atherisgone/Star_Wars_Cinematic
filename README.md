# Star Wars Cinematic — Unreal Engine

A cinematic Unreal Engine project focused on large-scale composition, lighting, and storytelling through visuals.  
This project explores atmosphere, scale, and cinematic language inspired by sci-fi military formations.

## 🎬 Project Overview

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
- **Project Type:** Cinematic / Non-Interactive
- **Platform:** Windows
- **Status:** Completed / Portfolio Project
- **Focus:** Visual storytelling, cinematic composition, rendering

This is **not a game**.  
The goal was to push cinematic quality, scene composition, and rendering inside Unreal Engine using real-time tools.

## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

This project was built as a **learning-driven cinematic**, covering the full real-time pipeline:

### 🔹 Modeling
- Working with high-poly and mid-poly assets
- Importing and optimizing external meshes
- Managing scale consistency across large scenes

### 🔹 Lighting
- Cinematic lighting setups
- Practical vs stylized lighting decisions
- Depth, contrast, and subject separation
- Using light to guide viewer focus

### 🔹 Materials & Textures
- Physically Based Materials (PBR)
- Texture organization and optimization
- Material instancing for performance and consistency

### 🔹 Scene Decoration
- Large-scale environment composition
- Repetition handling without visual monotony
- Set dressing for cinematic framing

### 🔹 Animation & Sequencer
- Sequencer workflow
- Character and crowd animation timing
- Shot-based storytelling
- Coordinating animation with camera movement

### 🔹 Camera, Rigs & Cinematics
- Cinematic Camera Actors
- Lens choice and depth of field
- Camera blocking and movement
- Framing for scale and hierarchy

### 🔹 Rendering
- Real-time cinematic rendering
- Exposure and color balance
- Final output preparation for video
